## Task Manager Website

This is a web-based task manager application where you can create, assign, and finish tasks. Tasks appear in a kanban view, and you can only see the tasks assigned to your department. You will also receive real-time notifications when a new task is created by another user in your department while you are online. You can also use real-time chat to interact with the task's author, but this is only possible if both users are online simultaneously.
